## OpenGl
OpenGL is mainly considered an **API**(an Application Programming Interface) that provides us with a large set of functions that we can use to manipulate graphics and images. However, OpenGL by itself is not an API, but merely a specification, developed and maintained by the [Khronos Group](https://www.khronos.org).

The OpenGL specification specifies exactly what the result/output of each function should be and how it should perform. It is then up to the developers *implementing* this specification to come up with a solution of how this function should operate. Since the OpenGL specification does not give us implementation details, the actual developed versions of OpenGL are allowed to have different implementations, as long as their results comply with the specification (and are thus the same to the user).
